### **MLDOC.md: Machine Learning Model Documentation for Career Quest**

---

### **1. Introduction**

This document provides a guide for developers to build, train, and integrate machine learning (ML) models for the **Career Quest** platform. The ML model is essential for analyzing student quiz data and generating personalized career suggestions. This document outlines the steps to create the model, its integration with the platform's backend, and the deployment process.

**Goal**: To build a model that processes quiz data (interests, strengths, personality traits) and offers personalized career guidance based on the inputs.

---

### **2. System Architecture**

- **Frontend**:
  - Users interact with the platform by taking quizzes to assess their career interests, strengths, and weaknesses.

- **Backend (Node.js)**:
  - **Node.js** handles API requests, communicates with the database (MongoDB), and sends tasks to the machine learning model via RabbitMQ.

- **Machine Learning Model (Python)**:
  - The Python-based ML model analyzes quiz data and generates career suggestions asynchronously through RabbitMQ.

- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ)**:
  - RabbitMQ manages asynchronous communication between the backend and the machine learning service, ensuring smooth handling of tasks and responses.

### **3. Model Architecture**

#### **Step 1: Choose the Right Model**

- **Algorithm**: Depending on the complexity of data and the desired output, consider these options:
  - **Decision Trees/Random Forests**: For simple classifications based on quiz results (e.g., categorizing users into interest groups).
  - **Neural Networks**: For more complex patterns and recommendations, especially when there is a need to account for multiple features and dependencies.

#### **Step 2: Input Data**

- **User Data**:
  - Quiz results on interests, strengths, and personality traits.
  - Numerical or categorical inputs (e.g., scores for arts, science, extroversion, etc.).

#### **Step 3: Feature Engineering**

- Transform quiz data into meaningful features:
  - **Interest Scores**: Map each interest area (e.g., arts, science, technology) to a numerical value.
  - **Personality Traits**: Convert qualitative traits (e.g., extroversion) into numerical features.

#### **Step 4: Model Output**

- **Career Suggestions**: Generate a ranked list of suitable careers based on the user's profile.
- **Recommended Skills**: Highlight skills the user should develop to align with career choices.

#### **Design Decisions**:
- **Decision Trees**: Offers interpretability and is easy to implement for categorical data.
- **Neural Networks**: More suited for complex datasets but requires more computational power.

### **4. Training Process**

#### **Step 1: Dataset**

- **Source**: Use anonymized quiz data from users, or publicly available career datasets.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalizing scores, etc.).

#### **Step 2: Training**

- **Training Data**: Organize quiz results into a format suitable for training (e.g., CSV or database export).
- **Training Steps**:
  - Split the data into **training** and **test** sets (80/20).
  - Apply any necessary **data augmentation** (if limited data is available).

#### **Step 3: Hyperparameters**

- **Learning Rate**: 0.01
- **Batch Size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 50 (adjust as needed for model performance).

#### **Step 4: Evaluation**

- Use evaluation metrics such as:
  - **Accuracy**: How well the model classifies career suggestions.
  - **Precision & Recall**: For relevance of career suggestions.
  - **F1-Score**: Balancing precision and recall.

### **5. Integration with Backend**

#### **Step 1: Communication via RabbitMQ**

- **Task Flow**:
  - **Node.js** sends quiz data to RabbitMQ.
  - RabbitMQ delivers the data to the **Python-based ML model**.
  - The ML model processes the data and sends the results (career suggestions) back through RabbitMQ.

#### **Step 2: Asynchronous Processing**

- The backend ensures that quiz data and career suggestions are processed without blocking other user requests, thanks to RabbitMQâ€™s asynchronous nature.

#### **Step 3: Example Code Snippet**

- **Node.js Backend Sending Task**:
  ```javascript
  // Send task to RabbitMQ
  const sendToQueue = (quizResults) => {
    const queue = 'career_suggestions';
    rabbitChannel.sendToQueue(queue, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(quizResults)));
  };
  ```

- **Python Receiving Task**:
  ```python
  import pika
  def process_message(ch, method, properties, body):
      quiz_data = json.loads(body)
      # ML model processes quiz_data
      career_suggestions = model.predict(quiz_data)
      # Send back results
      ch.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='results_queue', body=json.dumps(career_suggestions))
  ```

---

### **6. Deployment**

#### **Step 1: Python Model Setup**

- **Environment**: Set up a Python environment with the necessary libraries:
  - `pip install scikit-learn tensorflow pika`

- **RabbitMQ Configuration**:
  - Configure RabbitMQ to ensure smooth communication between the **Node.js backend** and the **Python ML model**.

#### **Step 2: Scaling the Model**

- Deploy the model on a scalable cloud service (e.g., **AWS Lambda**, **Google Cloud Functions**) to ensure that the system can handle increasing loads as the platform scales.

---

### **7. Dependencies**

#### **Python**:
- `scikit-learn` for traditional ML models (e.g., Decision Trees).
- `TensorFlow/PyTorch` for more advanced neural networks.
- `pandas` for data handling.
- `numpy` for numerical computations.
- `pika` for RabbitMQ communication.

#### **Node.js**:
- `Express` for API management.
- `Mongoose` for MongoDB.
- `amqplib` for RabbitMQ integration.

---

### **8. API Reference**

#### **Send Quiz Data to ML Model**:
- **POST /quiz-results**:
  ```json
  {
    "userId": "12345",
    "quizResults": {
      "interestScores": [4, 3, 5, 1],
      "personalityTraits": [1, 0, 0, 1],
      "skills": [3, 2, 4]
    }
  }
  ```

#### **Retrieve Career Suggestions**:
- **GET /career-suggestions/{userId}**:
  ```json
  {
    "careerSuggestions": ["Software Engineer", "Data Analyst"],
    "recommendedSkills": ["Python", "Data Science"]
  }
  ```

---

### **9. Usage Examples**

#### **Node.js Backend Communicating with Python ML Model**:
```javascript
// Node.js backend sends quiz data to RabbitMQ
sendToQueue({
  userId: '12345',
  quizResults: { interestScores: [3, 4, 5], personalityTraits: [1, 1, 0], skills: [2, 3, 4] }
});
```

```python
# Python code for ML model processing the received quiz data
def process_data(quiz_data):
    # Predict career suggestions based on quiz data
    return model.predict(quiz_data)
```

---

### **10. Troubleshooting**

- **Timeout Issues**: Ensure RabbitMQ has the correct timeout settings for long-running tasks.
- **Data Format Mismatch**: Verify that quiz data is formatted correctly before sending it to the model.
- **Scaling Challenges**: Adjust cloud settings (e.g., AWS Lambda) for proper scaling based on user demand.
